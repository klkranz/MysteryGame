        'had the suspect, and were going to lock the door to the scene of the crime. When Constable Bredon arrived, ' \
        'he found signs that multiple attempts on the victim’s life were made with various methods. What’s more, ' \
        'Medical Examiner Stevenson says the shot is unlikely to have killed him. The question seems to be who ' \
        'didn’t try to kill him. The witnesses are all in the conservatory and we took the housekeeper’s keys and ' \
        'locked all the other doors until we can do a thorough search.'
